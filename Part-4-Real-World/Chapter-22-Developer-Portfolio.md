# Why GitHub is Your Public Resume

Traditional resumes only claim skills.

GitHub proves skills.

Anyone can see:

* Your projects
* Your code
* Your activity
* Your consistency
* Your learning progress

Recruiters trust GitHub more than resumes.

Because it shows real work.

---

# What Recruiters Look For

Recruiters do not expect perfection.

They look for:

* Clean repositories
* Clear project structure
* Good README files
* Consistent commits
* Real projects

Even small projects build credibility.

Consistency matters more than complexity.

---

# Your First Goal

Create 3–5 clean projects.

Examples:

* Notes application
* Personal website
* Python automation tool
* Data analysis project
* Your AI Stock Analyzer

These projects prove capability.

---

# Repository Structure (Professional Standard)

Every professional repository contains:

```
project-name/
│
├── README.md
├── images/
├── src/
├── data/
└── requirements.txt
```

This makes your project organized.

Organization signals professionalism.

---

# The Most Important File — README.md

README.md is the first thing people see.

It explains your project.

A professional README contains:

* Project title
* Description
* Features
* Screenshots
* Installation instructions
* Usage instructions

Example:

```
# AI Stock Analyzer

An AI-powered trading analysis tool that identifies high-probability opportunities.

## Features

# Adding Screenshots

Screenshots increase credibility.

They show your project visually.

Example:

```
images/dashboard.png
```

Reference in README:

```
![Dashboard](images/dashboard.png)
```

Screenshots make your project look real.

---

# Pin Important Repositories

GitHub allows you to pin repositories.

Pinned repositories appear at top of profile.

Pin your best projects.

This creates a strong first impression.

---

# Write a Professional Profile Description

Go to GitHub profile settings.

Add description like:

```
Building AI-powered systems and trading analytics tools.
```

Keep it simple and clear.

---

# Commit Regularly

Frequent commits show activity.

Activity signals seriousness.

Even small commits matter.

Example:

```
git commit -m "Improved dashboard performance"
```

Consistency builds credibility.

---

# What Makes a Profile Look Professional

Professional profile has:

* Multiple repositories
* Clean README files
* Organized folders

This builds trust.

# Real World Truth

GitHub becomes your public proof.
