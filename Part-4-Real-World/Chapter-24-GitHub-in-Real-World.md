# Part 4: GitHub in the Real World

Until now, you have learned Git and GitHub as tools — commands, workflows, repositories, commits, and collaboration mechanics. But tools only become powerful when applied in the real world.

This part bridges the gap between *knowing GitHub* and *using GitHub as a professional developer.*

In the real world, GitHub is not just a storage platform. It is your:

* Portfolio
* Resume
* Collaboration space
* Proof of skill
* Professional identity

Employers don’t trust claims. They trust visible work. GitHub shows your thinking, your discipline, your consistency, and your ability to build real systems.

In this section, you will learn how developers actually use GitHub in professional environments. You will learn how to build a developer portfolio, contribute to open-source projects, integrate GitHub with professional tools like VS Code, and follow best practices that separate beginners from professionals.

These are not theoretical concepts. These are the exact practices used by working developers across the world.

By the end of this part, GitHub will no longer be just a tool you know. It will become an asset that works for you — continuously, silently, and professionally.

This is where GitHub stops being a learning exercise and starts becoming your career infrastructure.
