# Chapter 1 — What is Git, and Why It Exists

## The Fundamental Problem: Software Changes Constantly

Software is not written once. It evolves.

Every day, developers:

- Add features  
- Fix bugs  
- Improve performance  
- Experiment with new ideas  

Each change modifies files.

Without a system to track these changes, chaos emerges.

Files get overwritten.  
Working versions get lost.  
There is no reliable history.

Developers needed a system that could:

- Track every change  
- Restore previous versions  
- Show what changed and when  
- Allow safe experimentation  
- Support collaboration  

This is why Git was created.

## The Birth of Git

Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux.

He needed a system that could:

- Handle a massive codebase  
- Support thousands of contributors  
- Be extremely fast  
- Never lose history  

Today, Git is the foundation of modern software development.

## What Git Actually Does

Git is a **Version Control System**.

This means it records snapshots of your project over time.

Think of it like a time machine for your code.

Git records:

- What files changed  
- What exactly changed  
- When it changed  
- Who changed it  

You can return to any previous state instantly.

Nothing is lost.

## Example: Life Without Git

Imagine you are writing a simple Notes App.

Your folders might look like:

notes_app
notes_app_new
notes_app_final
notes_app_final_v2
notes_app_final_USE_THIS

You no longer know which version is correct.

Mistakes are easy to make.

Work can be lost.

## Example: Life With Git

With Git, your project stays clean:


Git tracks every version internally.

You can:

- Go back to previous versions  
- Compare changes  
- Undo mistakes safely  

---

## Git Works Locally

Git does not require internet.

It runs completely on your computer.

This makes it:

- Fast  
- Reliable  
- Private

## Git vs GitHub

This is important.

| Git | GitHub |
|-----|--------|
| Runs locally | Runs on internet |
| Tracks changes | Stores projects online |
| Version control tool | Hosting platform |
| Works offline | Requires internet |

Git = engine  
GitHub = cloud platform

## Why Every Developer Uses Git

Git provides:

- Safety  
- History  
- Control  
- Professional workflow  

Without Git, development is fragile.

With Git, development becomes reliable.

---

## Summary

Git is a system that tracks changes in your files and allows you to safely manage software projects.

It is the foundation of modern software engineering.
