# Part 1 — Foundations

This part builds the reader’s core understanding from absolute zero.

It is designed for someone who has never used Git or GitHub before, and may not even fully understand how modern software is managed. Instead of assuming prior knowledge, this section carefully constructs the mental model required to use GitHub confidently.

The reader will learn what Git is, why it exists, and how it solves real problems developers face. They will understand how files are tracked, how changes are recorded, and how GitHub stores and manages projects in the cloud.

Every concept is introduced in a simple, practical way, ensuring the reader does not just memorize commands, but understands what is actually happening behind the scenes.

By the end of Part 1, the reader will no longer see GitHub as something confusing or intimidating. They will understand its purpose, its structure, and how to use it for their own projects.

Result: The reader gains a strong and clear foundation.
