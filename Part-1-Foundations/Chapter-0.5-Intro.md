# Part 1 — Foundations

Git is a tool that tracks changes to files over time so you can collaborate and manage projects, while GitHub is the online platform where Git repositories are stored, shared, and worked on collaboratively.

This part builds your core understanding from absolute zero — even if you’ve never used Git or GitHub before. We’ll carefully construct the mental model required to use these tools confidently.

## Roadmap of the Book

The roadmap below shows how this book is structured and where this part fits in:

This book is structured into four main parts:

- **Part 1 – Foundations:** Learn the basics of Git, version control, and setting up your first repositories.  
- **Part 2 – Professional Workflow:** Dive into branching, merging, collaboration, and professional Git workflows.  
- **Part 3 – Advanced Git:** Explore advanced topics like rebasing, stashing, and real-world problem solving.  
- **Part 4 – Real-World Usage:** Build your developer portfolio, contribute to open source, and apply best practices in real projects.

By the end of this book, you will not only understand Git and GitHub deeply, but also know how to use them professionally in real-world projects.


## What You Will Learn in Part 1

Before you start with commands and workflows, here’s what this part will help you achieve:

> **By the end of this part, you will:**

> - Track changes and manage files confidently  
> - Use GitHub to store and manage projects in the cloud

## Key Concepts Visual

Every concept is introduced in a simple, practical way, ensuring you don’t just memorize commands — you understand what’s actually happening behind the scenes:
