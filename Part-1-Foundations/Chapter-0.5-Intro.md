Git is a tool that tracks changes to files over time so you can collaborate and manage projects, while GitHub is the online platform where Git repositories are stored, shared, and worked on collaboratively.

This part builds your core understanding from absolute zero — even if you’ve never used Git or GitHub before. We’ll carefully construct the mental model required to use these tools confidently.
