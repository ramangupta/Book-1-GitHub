# Part 1 — Foundations

Introduction

Welcome to GitHub for Beginners — a practical guide that takes you step by step through Git, GitHub, their workflows, and how they are used in real-world software development. This book is designed especially for new developers and anyone who wants to confidently use version control to manage code and collaborate with others.

If you’ve ever felt intimidated by Git commands, branching, or merging — you’re in the right place. We’ll explain concepts from first principles, give you hands-on examples, and guide you toward understanding why Git and GitHub are essential skills for every developer.

This book will help you:

Understand version control and Git fundamentals

Learn how to create and manage repositories

Work with commits, branches, merges, and collaboration workflows

Explore advanced topics like rebasing, stashing, and conflict resolution

Apply Git skills in real development scenarios

By the end, you’ll have the confidence to use Git and GitHub both independently and with teams — powering personal projects and contributing to open-source work.

## Roadmap of the Book

The roadmap below shows how this book is structured and where this part fits in:

This book is structured into four main parts:

- **Part 1 – Foundations:** Learn the basics of Git, version control, and setting up your first repositories.  
- **Part 2 – Professional Workflow:** Dive into branching, merging, collaboration, and professional Git workflows.  
- **Part 3 – Advanced Git:** Explore advanced topics like rebasing, stashing, and real-world problem solving.  
- **Part 4 – Real-World Usage:** Build your developer portfolio, contribute to open source, and apply best practices in real projects.

By the end of this book, you will not only understand Git and GitHub deeply, but also know how to use them professionally in real-world projects.


## What You Will Learn in Part 1

Before you start with commands and workflows, here’s what this part will help you achieve:

> **By the end of this part, you will:**  
> - Understand what Git is and why it exists  
> - Track changes and manage files confidently  
> - Use GitHub to store and manage projects in the cloud

## Key Concepts Visual

Every concept is introduced in a simple, practical way, ensuring you don’t just memorize commands — you understand what’s actually happening behind the scenes:

Git is a tool that tracks changes to files over time so you can collaborate and manage projects, while GitHub is the online platform where Git repositories are stored, shared, and worked on collaboratively.

This part builds your core understanding from absolute zero — even if you’ve never used Git or GitHub before. We’ll carefully construct the mental model required to use these tools confidently.

By the end of Part 1, you’ll no longer see GitHub as confusing or intimidating. You’ll understand its purpose, its structure, and how to use it for your own projects.
