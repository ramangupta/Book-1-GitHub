# Chapter 12 — GitHub Web Interface (Managing Projects Visually)

Until now, you have used Git through the terminal.

You created repositories.
You added files.
You committed changes.
You created branches.
You merged changes.

All using commands.

But professional developers also use GitHub’s web interface.

GitHub provides a visual interface to view and manage your project.

This makes it easier to understand and control your repository.

---

## What is GitHub Web Interface

GitHub Web Interface is the website where your repository is hosted.

It allows you to:

* View files
* View commits
* View branches
* View history
* Create and edit files
* Manage your project

All without using the terminal.

GitHub provides a complete visual control system for your repository.

---

## Open Your Repository

Go to your browser.

Open:

```
https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository
```

You will see your repository dashboard.

This is your project control center.

---

## Viewing Files

The main page shows all files in your repository.

Example:

```
notes.txt
feature.txt
README.md
```

You can click any file to view its contents.

GitHub shows the exact contents stored in your repository.

This allows you to inspect your project easily.

---

## Viewing Commit History

Click the **"Commits"** button.

You will see a list like:

```
Added new feature
Fixed bug
Created project
```

Each commit shows:

* Commit message
* Author
* Date

This is the same history you saw using:

```bash
git log
```

But now you can see it visually.

---

## Viewing Branches

Click the **"Branch"** dropdown.

Example:

```
main
new-feature
```

This shows all branches in your repository.

You can switch between branches.

GitHub will show files for that branch.

This helps visualize branch structure.

---

## Viewing Individual Commits

Click any commit.

GitHub will show:

* Files changed
* Lines added
* Lines removed

This allows you to inspect exact changes.

This is extremely useful for debugging and review.

---

## Editing Files Directly in GitHub

You can edit files without using terminal.

Steps:

1. Open a file
2. Click the edit icon (pencil icon)
3. Make changes
4. Click Commit changes

GitHub will create a new commit.

Your project is updated.

---

## GitHub and Git Work Together

Git works locally on your computer.

GitHub works remotely on the server.

Together they create a complete version control system.

Git tracks changes.

GitHub stores and shares changes.

This makes collaboration possible.

---

## Professional Workflow with GitHub

Professional developers use both:

Terminal for development
GitHub for management and review

GitHub allows teams to:

* Review code
* Track changes
* Manage branches
* Collaborate efficiently

GitHub provides visibility and control.

---

## What You Achieved

You can now use GitHub visually.

You understand how to:

* View files
* View commits
* View branches
* Inspect changes
* Edit files

You now have complete control over your repository.

Terminal gives you power.

GitHub gives you visibility.

Together, they form the complete professional Git workflow.

## Next Step

You will now learn how professional teams collaborate using Pull Requests.

This is the foundation of team-based development.
